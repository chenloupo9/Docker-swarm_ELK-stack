# Elastic stack (ELK) on Docker swarm 

This is simple repository for creating a docker swarm with one manager and two worker nodes and deploying an ELK stack, which will give you the ability to analyze any data set by using searching/aggregation capabilities of Elasticsearch and the visualization power of kibana. 

## Requirements 
1. **Docker Engine** version 17.05 or newer 
2. **Docker Compose** version 1.20.0 or newer 
3. Host with an available 2CPU and 4GB Memory at least 

- I was using the [Play-with-docker](https://labs.play-with-docker.com/) website to run this ELK stack.
